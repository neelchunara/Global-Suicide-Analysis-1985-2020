### Introduction

We aimed to analyze the Suicide data collected globally from 1985 to 2020. Suicide, a highly intricate issue, inflicts pain upon hundreds of thousands worldwide yearly. Our primary goal in this data compilation is to contribute to an informed and open discussion regarding how suicide rates are impacted. Our project seeks to identify and elucidate connections between suicide rates and factors such as gender, age groups/generations, Country, and GDP. We meticulously processed, examined, and presented this data in the form of a dashboard, making it more understandable for users and yielding more insightful findings.
